# Brazilian E-Commerce Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze + visualize Brazilian e-commerce data to gain insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance. The dataset comprises 7 CSV files containing information about orders, customers, products, and reviews.

## Tools Used
- Excel: Initial data exploration and basic cleaning.
- SQL: Data cleaning, integration, storing, and preprocessing.
- Python: Advanced data cleaning, analysis, and modeling.
- R: Statistical analysis and visualization.
- Tableau && Power BI: Data visualization and dashboard creation.
- GitHub: Repository hosting and version control.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**
   - Utilize Python for detailed data cleaning tasks, handling missing values, foreign key violations, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
   - Apply Python for further data transformation and feature engineering.
   - Use SQL to create a relational database, load CSV files, and perform basic cleaning.
   - Use SQL for data integration through JOIN operations and additional transformations.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Use SQL for basic summary statistics.
   - Utilize Python/R for in-depth EDA, exploring distributions, correlations, and trends.

3. **Advanced Analysis and Modeling (Optional)**
   - Apply statistical analysis or machine learning techniques using Python/R for deeper insights or predictive modeling.

4. **Data Visualization**
   - Create visualizations using Tableau/Power BI to represent insights effectively.
   - Utilize Python/R for customized visualizations to showcase key findings.

5. **Documentation, Presentation and Reporting**
   - Document the analysis process and findings using Microsoft Word/Google Docs.
   - Utilize GitHub repository for version-controlled documentation.
   - Prepare a presentation summarizing the analysis and insights using PowerPoint/Google Slides.

## Project Structure
