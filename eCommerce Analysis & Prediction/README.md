# Brazilian E-Commerce Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze Brazilian e-commerce data to gain insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance. The dataset comprises 7 CSV files containing information about orders, customers, products, and reviews.

## Tools Used
- Excel: Initial data exploration and basic cleaning.
- SQL: Data cleaning, integration, and preprocessing.
- Python: Advanced data cleaning, analysis, and modeling.
- R: Statistical analysis and visualization.
- Tableau/Power BI: Data visualization and dashboard creation.
- GitHub: Repository hosting and version control.

## Project Steps
1. **Data Collection and Understanding**
   - Obtain the dataset and preview it using Excel to understand its structure and contents.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
   - Use SQL to create a relational database, load CSV files, and perform basic cleaning.
   - Utilize Python for detailed data cleaning tasks, handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

3. **Data Integration and Transformation**
   - Use SQL for data integration through JOIN operations and additional transformations.
   - Apply Python for further data transformation and feature engineering.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Use SQL for basic summary statistics.
   - Utilize Python/R for in-depth EDA, exploring distributions, correlations, and trends.

5. **Advanced Analysis and Modeling (Optional)**
   - Apply statistical analysis or machine learning techniques using Python/R for deeper insights or predictive modeling.

6. **Data Visualization**
   - Create visualizations using Tableau/Power BI to represent insights effectively.
   - Utilize Python/R for customized visualizations to showcase key findings.

7. **Documentation and Reporting**
   - Document the analysis process and findings using Microsoft Word/Google Docs.
   - Utilize GitHub repository for version-controlled documentation.

8. **Presentation**
   - Prepare a presentation summarizing the analysis and insights using PowerPoint/Google Slides.

9. **GitHub Repository**
   - Set up a GitHub repository to host the project files, including data, code, documentation, and presentation.

10. **Project Showcase**
    - Showcase the project on GitHub, providing an overview of the analysis process, insights, and visualizations in the README file.
